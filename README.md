# A description of each item in the repository: 
- **limmaFit.R** Wrapper function for LIMMA linear modeling. It preprocesses the data (e.g., drops rows/columns with all NAs, checks model specifications), fits linear models, and applies empirical Bayes moderation to assess differential expression across features. Implemented in "1_DEA.R".
- **limmaDEA.R** Wrapper for performing differential analysis using the limma package, specifically through moderated t-tests or F-tests on coefficients derived from an MArrayLM object. It allows for flexible testing across multiple contrasts or coefficients, with options for global or individual adjustment of p-values to control the false discovery rate. Implemented in "1_DEA.R".
- **0a_loading_intensity_data.R** Converts the output of TopPIC searches to an MSnSet object that stores label-free quantification data. Final data is on a relative log2-scale.
- **0b_loading_spectralcount_data.R** Converts the output of TopPIC searches to an MSnSet object that stores spectral count data. 
- **1_DEA.R** Takes output of script "0a" and performs differential abundance analysis using the functions "limmaFit.R" and "limmaDEA.R". 
- **Figure1_overview_plots.R** Takes output of script "0a" and generates Figure 1, including quantifying the number of distinct and average proteoforms/genes and the completeness of those identifications. Also generates Figure S1. Histogram of observed proteoform monoisotopic masses. 
- **Figure2_ins_gcg_rect_lines.R** Takes output of script "0b" and generates Figure 2: Rectangle plots of most frequently observed proteoforms of insulin and glucagon.
- **Figure3_volcano_plots_rawp.R** Takes output of script "1_DEA" and generates Figure 3: Volcano plots of all and curated proteoforms.
- **Figure4_CXCL.R** Takes output of script "0a" and generates Figure 4: Heatmap and table summary of observed CXCL proteoforms. Performs hypergeometric probability distribution test to determine which unique observations are statistically significant.
- **FigureSI_HMGN.R** Takes output of script "0a" and generates Figure S7: Heatmap and table summary of observed HMGN proteoforms. 
- **FigureSI_RSD.R** Takes output of script "0a" and generates Figure S2: Histogram of relative standard deviations based on label-free quantification data. Facets data into control and cytokine treated samples. 
- **FigureSI_chga_b_sst_rect_lines.R** Takes output of script "0b" and generates Figure S4 and S5: Rectangle plots of most frequently observed proteoforms of chromogranin-A, secretogranin-1 a.k.a. CHGB, and somatostatin.
- **Figure_1A_tdislets.png** Graphical abstract for project. This file is for beauty and not needed for any analysis.
